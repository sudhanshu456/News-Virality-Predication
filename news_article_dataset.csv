Rajasthan’s recovery rate of 33% for Covid-19 patients is higher than the national average of 23%, the state’s health department said Tuesday.

The recovery rate has been boosted partly by the fact that 66% of those infected are in a younger age group, he said.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), elderly people above 60 years of age face the highest risk from the coronavirus.

The Rajasthan health department’s data shows that 66.67% of the population in the 20 to 60 years age group, which has better immunity, has been infected. The percentage of the population infected in the 60-80 years age group is only 10.5.

This has helped push up Rajasthan’s recovery rate. The state has recorded 2,335 positive cases so far and. Of these, 768 or 32.8% have recovered while 584 people have been discharged from hospitals after treatment, the health department said in the afternoon.

Only those who test negative twice in line with Covid-19 treatment protocol are discharged.

“We have made very good progress as far as recovery of positive patients is concerned. Of the 2328 cases, 766 or one-third have recovered and 584 have been discharged,” Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma had said hours before the health department released its data.

Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent of Jaipur’s SMS Hospital, said the reason for the recovery rate is that a higher proportion of the younger population in Rajasthan has been infected with the coronavirus. The younger population has been more affected more because they tend to move out more than the elderly.

“It is fortunate for us that the virus has infected a larger proportion of the younger age group who have better immunity and health and can fight off the disease more successfully than elderly patients,” he said.

Data from the health department shows that 41.75% of those infected are in the age group 20 to 40 years. The infection among the 40-50 years age group is 13.59% and 11.33% in the 50-60 years age group.

Coronavirus has so far affected 28 of 33 districts in the state. Pratapgarh which had recorded two cases of Covid-19 has shown a 100% recovery rate.

Bikaner has a recovery rate of 97.2% with 36 of 37 patients having recovered while one died. In Jhunjhunu, 40 of 42 patients have recovered (95.2%) while in Churu, 13 of 14 patients have recovered (92.8%).

In Bhilwara, which was once a Covid-19 hotspot, 30 of the 35 patients have recovered (85.7%). Jaisalmer has the same figures as Bhilwara.

Dungarpur where five of six patients have recovered has a recovery rate of 83.3% while Alwar with five of seven cases recovering has a rate of 71.4%. Three districts – Karauli, Pali and Udaipur share a recovery rate of 66.6%.

In Udaipur, four of six patients have recovered while in Karauli and Pali, two of three patients each have recovered.

In the state capital Jaipur, 273 of the 856 cases have recovered (31.8%). In an encouraging development, 192 people who tested negative twice for the Sars-Cov 2 virus were discharged from the SMS hospital on Monday, the health department said.","Covid-19: At 33%, Rajasthan’s recovery rate higher than national average of 23%",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-at-33-rajasthan-s-recovery-rate-higher-than-national-average-of-23/story-hamBYhRto5FTabjT2rAN2J.html

Over four per cent of health workers in Delhi including 33 doctors have become affected due to coronavirus said Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and added that this situation as “worrying”.

Harsh Vardhan’s comments reported by a news agency were made on Tuesday when the minister held a review meeting via video conference with top officials of the state, including the lieutenant governor (LG), health minister, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) commissioners and DCPs of all districts of the national capital along with surveillance officers and heads of government hospitals.

“13 paramedics, 26 nurses, 24 field workers, 33 doctors are COVID19 affected. This is worrying,” Harsh Vardhan is reported to have said.

A dashboard of medical care professionals and volunteers deployed across the country prepared by the health ministry as part of the containment efforts says Delhi has nearly 18,000 MBBS doctors involved in fighting coronavirus, 2530 MBBS students, 43,865 Nurses, 12,011 Dentists, 11,213 Ayush workers, 350 lab volunteers, 5809 ex-Servicemen, 10,628 NYKS volunteers, 4478 trained health professionals among other categories of manpower.

The health ministry had recently written to all states asking them to take utmost care of their health care professionals while listing out measures taken for their safety.

It recommended that states used Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of Sars-Cov-2 infection for high risk population including all asymptomatic health care workers who were involved in the care of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases. It also states that nearly 5.11 lakh additional PPEs (Personal Protection Equipment) had been supplied by the Centre to the states to augment the existing stock of 2.75 lakhs of PPE available with the states.

Delhi has 4039 cases of coronavirus as per the latest figures released by the ministry of health and nearly 100 containment zones—areas with positive cases that present a threat of further transmissions. Dr Harsh Vardhan said that this number should come down before adding that the existing periphery of the containment zones could be increased to fight the disease better.

“According to experts, we need to increase the periphery of sealed areas in Delhi to fight Covid-19 better,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said while talking about the containment efforts in Delhi.

The Union health ministry on Tuesday advised against considering the plasma therapy to be a regular treatment for coronavirus and added that it should only be used for research and trial purposes till the time there’s robust scientific evidence to support its efficacy.

The government added further that plasma therapy could lead to life-threatening complications if not administered properly.

“There is no approved therapy for Covid-19 in the country including Plasma therapy. Plasma therapy is being experimented with and there is no evidence to support it as a treatment. It is only at an experimental stage. If not used properly, it can create life-threatening complications,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary health ministry.

The health ministry official said that the country’s top medical research body was conducting a study to find out the efficacy of plasma therapy and till then, doctors are advised to use it only for trial purposes.

“Plasma therapy is only to be used for research and trial purposes until an ICMR study on its efficacy is completed. ICMR is conducting a nation-wide research to study the efficacy of Plasma therapy,” he added.

Government’s word of caution on plasma therapy comes at a time when several instances of it helping in virus-infected patients’ recovery have been reported. The Plasma therapy has been used selectively so far, mostly in severe cases where patients were on ventilator support.

The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19

Use of plasma therapy involves injecting blood-component plasma extracted from a cured coronavirus patient into a positive case. The plasma of a cured patient is considered to carry virus-fighting antibodies which boost the immune system’s response to the disease. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood.

Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma, which contains the virus-fighting antibodies, from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19

Several Covid-19 fighting medical care centres in India are reported to have started banking plasma from coronavirus recovered patients after its use was said to have shown positive results.

A few days ago, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain had reported that six critical coronavirus patients had “nearly recovered” after administration of the plasma therapy. On April 26, it was reported that Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital, too, had identified Maharashtra’s first patient to be given the therapy.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday asked the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) to draw up contingency plans for resuming operations after the lockdown to combat the coronavirus disease is lifted, the ministry said in a statement.

Singh said such plans were necessary to ramp up production and compensate for the time lost due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Singh spoke to top officials of the OFB and DPSUs, via video conference, and reviewed operational plans as well as their contribution to the fight against the pandemic.

Several units of the OFB and DPSUs located in non-red zones have already kicked off operations and drawn up plans for post-lockdown operations, the ministry statement said. Defence ministry officials said the units of the OFB and DPSUs plan to work in three shifts six days a week (against the usual five) to speed up production. Work will be carried out by observing social distancing and other relevant health guidelines, the officials said.

The defence ministry statement said that Singh referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to revive the economy post-lockdown and said that the DPSUs along with the private defence industry could play a major role in the revival.

Singh praised the efforts of DPSUs in coming out with new products to fight Covid-19 and also the assistance provided by them to the local administration.

The OFB’s contribution in fighting Covid- 19 includes the repair of more than 100 ventilators, manufacture 12,800 coveralls, development of specialised machines for testing of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and supply of 6.35 lakh masks to local authorities, the statement said.

The OFB has also earmarked 280 isolation beds at hospitals spread across 10 locations.

The statement said Bharat Electronics Ltd is ready to manufacture 12,000 ventilators in May and another 18,000 in June to support the national effort to tackle the disease. Around 3,000 engineers will help train health professionals in operationalising the ventilators, the ministry said.

The Congress on Tuesday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre after a RTI query a couple of days ago revealed that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had written off a staggering amount of Rs 68,607 crore due from 50 defaulters, including absconding jeweller Nirav Modi and his partner Mehul Choksi.

Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala who was interacting with the media via a video conference cited the RTI query and demanded to know how the government had the money to waive bad loans when the entire country was facing financial instability due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Waiving off bad loans of huge amounts for willful defaulters has become the mantra of the BJP. On March 16, 2020, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had demanded to know the names of 50 loan defaulters from the Union government on the floor of the house. The government had refused to divulge those names. On April 24, these bad loans were written off. When the entire country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic and at least 14 crore people have lost their livelihood, how can the government possibly waive Rs 68,607 crore in bad loans?” Surjewala questioned.

“The Modi government has been unmasked and the fact that it is working towards writing off such bad debts shows that the government is hand in glove with the defaulters. In the list of 50 defaulters, absconding diamantaire Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi are on top. We demand answers,” the Congress leader said.

“Can the Modi government afford to waive such bad debts and if it manages to do so, the government needs to inform citizens how that is possible,” Surjewala said.

Simultaneously, Surjewala reiterated the Congress party’s pledge to fight the Covid-19 health crisis along with the government and provide every possible support that the Centre may need.

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the central government to examine the feasibility of implementing the ‘one nation one ration card’ scheme during the Covid-19 lockdown so as to alleviate the hardships faced by migrant labourers who have been stranded in other states due to the lockdown.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, passed the order on a plea by one Reepak Kansal, who had highlighted the plight of migrant labourers because they did not have local identity proof.

“…we direct the Union of India to consider whether it is feasible for it to implement the said scheme at this stage or not and take an appropriate decision in this regard keeping in view the present circumstances,” the court said disposing of the plea.

The ‘one nation one ration card’ scheme formulated by the central government is proposed to kick in from June 2020.

The petitioner pointed out that many migrant workers who left their home state to work in other cities have been confined to their rented accommodation and are unable to return to their home states due to the lockdown.

They have run out of food and with no local identity proof like ration card or voter card to avail government benefits like subsidised food grains, they are facing hunger.

“States and Union Territories have been giving preferences to its respective citizens and voters and denying benefits of subsidised grains, shelter, medical facilities to said migrants laborers/ employees of other states due to absence of local identity proof i.e. ration card/residential proof/ voter card,” the petitioner claimed.

The petitioner, therefore, prayed that the ‘one nation one ration card’ scheme which is proposed to come into effect from June 2020 should be implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic so that migrant labourers are not denied subsidised food grains and other government benefits.

“Indian Government as well as State Governments have to adopt the scheme of ‘One Nation One Umbrella’ without any discrimination and to save human lives”, the plea said.","SC asks Centre to consider ‘one nation, one ration card’ during lockdown",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-centre-to-consider-one-nation-one-ration-card-during-lockdown/story-9fCuLyZBID38UqdZQpMq0M.html

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath over the killing of two sadhus in UP’s Bulandshahr and expressed concern over it. Thackeray called for strict punishment for the perpetrators of the “heinous” crime and said that the incident should not be given a communal colour.

“I spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji over the phone and expressed concern over the heinous murder of two sadhus in UP’s Bulandshahr. I told him that we are with you. Just the way we acted strongly in such a case, I wish you would do the same and bring the accused to justice. However, I appeal to you that the incident should not be given a communal colour,” Thackeray said.

Adityanath had spoken to Thackeray after two sadhus were lynched in Maharashtra’s Palghar district earlier this month. The Maharashtra home department had subsequently booked over 100 people in connection with the case.

While the BJP leaders suggested that the killing was intentional, the state government dismissed any communal angle in the Palghar lynching incident.

Sena leader Sanjay Raut had earlier tweeted on the killings, warning against giving it a communal twist. “Terrible! Killing of two saints, sadhus at a temple in Bulandshahar, UP, but I appeal to all concerned to not make it communal the way they tried to make Palghar, Maharashtra incident,” Raut said.

The bodies of the two sadhus were found inside a temple in a village in Bulandshahr on Monday night. The police arrested Murari alias Raju in connection with the murder of Jagdish or Rangidas, 55, and his 46-year-old disciple Sher Singh. The man told the police that it was “God’s will”.

“The accused claimed during interrogation that it was the will of God meaning there was no personal enmity,” a senior government official said while speaking to reporters.

Officials said Raju allegedly had an altercation with the sadhus over stealing their ‘chimta’ or tong.","In Thackeray’s phone call after 2 sadhus killed, a stinging jibe at Adityanath",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bulandshahr-killing-uddhav-thackeray-speaks-to-yogi-adityanath-calls-for-strict-punishment/story-nxngqislG20K0iQM7NrRaJ.html

The Kohima bench of the Gauhati High Court on Tuesday directed the Nagaland government to set up two Covid-19 testing labs within 10 days.

Acting on a PIL filed by V Suokhrie, a division bench of Justice Songkhupchung Serto and Justice S. Hukato Swu ordered the Nagaland government to “make at least two testing labs of Covid-19 functional within 10 days”.

The court also directed the government to “make every effort to establish other labs at strategic places in the state to facilitate free testing in the future”.

Nagaland doesn’t have a single testing lab for Covid-19 and all its samples are sent to labs in Assam. Till Monday, 629 samples from the state had been tested.

The lone Covid-19 case from the state, a 33-year businessman from Dimapur is undergoing treatment at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH). He has also been counted among the Covid-19 patients of Assam by the Union health and family welfare ministry.

“The PIL was filed seeking the court’s indulgence on certain gaps which the respondents might have overlooked while dealing with Covid-19 preparedness in Nagaland,” said Neiteo Koza, counsel for the petitioner.

Though an IAF aircraft landed in Dimapur on April 16 with equipment needed to set up bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) lab in Nagaland to test samples of suspected Covid-19 patients, the facility has not yet started functioning.

In its order, the HC asked the state government to provide sufficient PPE kits to all persons involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients and looking after persons in quarantine centres.

Till Monday 31 people were in quarantine in the state and 1,090 people had been screened, Nagaland health minister S Pangnyu Phom said.

The bench also directed that the state government should increase the number of ICU facilities and ventilators, provide ambulances to Covid-19 patients at the earliest and ensure that there is no shortage of trained personnel.

“The state received another batch of equipment to set up a BSL-3 testing lab at Dimapur and some additional equipment for the BSL-2 lab in Kohima on Monday. The health department also received 10 new ambulances on Tuesday which will cater exclusively to Covid-19 patients and those in quarantine,” Phom said.

The bench asked the government to ensure that the two hospitals - one in Dimapur and one in Kohima – are dedicated for treatment of Covid-19 patients are fully equipped and functional within two weeks.",High Court directs Nagaland to set up Covid-19 testing labs in 10 days,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-directs-nagaland-to-set-up-covid-19-testing-labs-in-10-days/story-3P3Da5SJ6T5tvaPe6qIxlO.html

Rajasthan reported two separate incidents of suspected rape of minors from Ajmer and Sirohi districts o n Monday, according to the police.

In Ajmer, an unidentified person abducted an 11-year-old girl at around 4 am on Monday from the courtyard of the house, where she was sleeping with her parents. “Her mother woke her father when she found that their daughter was missing on Monday early morning,” said Mahaveer Sharma, station house officer (SHO), Kekri police station, Ajmer district.

“An hour later, her parents found her in a field about a kilometre away from their home and her clothes were stained in blood. The parents lodged a first information report (FIR) on Monday and a case was registered against the unknown accused under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and Sections 376 (rape), and 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” SHO Sharma said.

In Sirohi district, a 15-year-old minor girl was allegedly abducted and raped for three consecutive days by a person known to her. On Monday, the accused dropped the rape survivor at her home after which she shared the ordeal with her parents.

Sumer Singh, station house officer (SHO), Pindwara police station, Sirohi district, said that on April 23 after the family finished their dinner, the teenager’s mother told her to lock the entrance gate of the house.

“When she went near the entrance gate, one of her friends in the neighbourhood called her. While she going to her friend’s house, the accused, who is known her, kidnapped her by gagging her mouth. She was taken to a nearby government-run school, which is closed because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and raped her for three consecutive days,” said SHO Singh.

“On Monday, her family members filed an FIR. A case was registered under the POCSO Act and Section 376 (rape) and other relevant sections of the IPC. The rape survivor’s statement has been recorded.

Another scientist studying rivers in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley has warned the government about climate change-induced natural hazards that hydropower dams may not be able to withstand.

Chintan Sheth’s letter to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the Union ministry of environment has come after several scientists issued a similar warning to the government over granting forest clearance for the 3,097 megawatt (MW) Etalin hydroelectric project in an area rich in subtropical evergreen and rain forests and rare flora and fauna.

Dibang Valley has close to 300 glaciers in an area of 200 sqkm and there are about 350 glacial lakes covering an area of 50 sqkm. Glacial lakes indicate these areas had much larger glaciers that have now completely melted due to warming, Sheth has said in his three-page letter.

Suggesting a cautious approach to siting hydropower projects in the region, the former research fellow with National Centre for Biological Sciences said Arunachal Pradesh has a vast elevation gradient and is drained by Tibetan rivers such as the Subansiri, Lohit and Siang.

It is well known that these rivers are primarily fed by melting glaciers, snow cover and monsoon rainfall so are the rivers in Dibang Valley, he said.

“I have currently mapped and detected rapid melting of glaciers since 2009 on the Mathũ (Mathun), Dri and Talõ (Tangon) rivers as well as recent emergence and expansion of glacial lakes,” he wrote.

“The Etalin hydroelectric power project proposes two dams on these rivers. The risk of such projects upstream closer to glaciers and glacial lakes is extremely high due to the unpredictable nature of the volume and flow rate during glacial lake outburst floods,” he said.

Though Sheth has flagged concerns for all projects in the region, FAC is currently considering granting forest clearance to the Etalin hydropower project.

The risk of hydropower projects upstream closer to glaciers and glacial lakes is extremely high due to the unpredictable nature of the volume and flow rate during glacial lake outburst floods.

Dam breach model studies for hydropower projects account for only extreme rainfall floods.

“Even if the dam structures do withstand a glacial lake outburst flood, the dam itself acts as a barrier effectively creating a lake that drains after overtopping. In effect, a dam creates a second lake that floods further downstream, after it over-topples, rapidly increasing the energy and flow rate of water,” Sheth said.

“In contrast the natural topography of a river allows the water to spread and dissipate energy across the length and width of the river channel decreasing the flow rates as the flood propagates downstream,” he added.

Anil Kulkarni, a glaciologist at Indian Institute of Science, said: “The glaciers there are relatively small and they have not been studied enough.”

“We have to understand that the climate is changing and will change significantly in the coming years. First, we need to understand how climate will change in the region and how the pattern of stream runoff will be influenced,” Kulkarni said over the phone from Bengaluru.

“Another study needed is will there be a change in the volume of water in future? Also in case of a run of the river projects, the distance between the dam and the outlet is usually dry which causes irreversible changes to aquatic life and water availability for local people. We need to critically study these impacts,” he said.

HT had reported on April 23 that a sub-committee of FAC, which visited the Etalin hydropower project site in February, has recommended in their report on April 21 that the project of 3097MW can be allowed with a condition that the developer deposit money for wildlife conservation in the area.

The project will involve diversion of 1150.08 ha of forest land and felling of 2.7 lakh trees in what is described as “subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest and subtropical rain forests” in FAC’s documents.

“A decision on the Etalin Hydropower project will be announced when the minutes of the FAC meeting is released,” a committee member said.","Another scientist writes to govt, warns about climate change impact in Dibang Valley over hydro projects",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-scientist-writes-to-govt-warns-about-climate-change-impact-in-dibang-valley-over-hydro-projects/story-fZa3k6Dzba585Mq5C8UzkL.html

A 56-year-old woman from Nainital district tested positive for Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh on Tuesday, informed officials. With this, the tally of Coronavirus positive patients in Uttarakhand has increased to 52 with 33 patients recovering successfully.

Harish Mohan Thapliyal, public relations officer of AIIMS Rishikesh said that the 56-year-old woman had been admitted to the hospital due to an ailment in her brain and she tested positive before the procedure on Tuesday.

“The lady, a resident of Nainital was first admitted to a hospital there and then referred to a hospital in Bareilly before being admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh on April 22. We took her samples yesterday evening for a precautionary test before conducting any medical procedure on her and she tested positive today. The next course of action is being decided by the doctors,” said Thapliyal.

He added that the woman had tested negative twice earlier when she was tested in Nainital and Bareilly.

“As the woman had tested negative twice, we are trying to find out her source of contracting the virus. Here, she was first kept in an emergency ward and we are tracing out her contacts, but as a primary measure we will be keeping around 70 staff members of ours under quarantine and testing them,” added the official.

On Sunday, a nursing officer from AIIMS Rishikesh had tested positive for coronavirus.

UB Mishra, dean of AIIMS Rishikesh said that a nursing officer working with the urology department tested positive on Sunday after first showing symptoms on April 24.

As the foreign and civil aviation ministries start work on a plan to fly back tens of thousands of Indians stuck abroad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spelt out the ground rule for the evacuation plan. India’s blue collar workers stranded abroad will get the first seats in the special flights that will be run by the government to get them home.

Students stranded in different countries will be next. Then, everyone else including Indians who were travelling for work, or pleasure.

“The prime minister was very clear… That the Indian expatriate workforce should get the first choice to return,” a top government official told Hindustan Times.

At one meeting, PM Modi pointed out how the poorest of Indian immigrant workers - mostly in the Gulf countries - had helped India tide over the economic crisis. Like in 1998, PM Modi told them, when the United States and other western countries imposed economic sanctions on India after the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee detonated five underground nuclear bombs in Pokhran in May 1998.

The Resurgent India Bond floated by the State Bank of India was targeted to raise $2 billion; it netted more than $4 billion.

Two decades later, India’s massive diaspora is still sending money home. In 2019, according to the World Bank, India was still the world’s top recipient of remittances. The diaspora sent $82 billion; nearly half came from migrant workers in West Asia.

But the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the Indian workers in West Asian countries hard. Many have lost their jobs due to suspension of projects and are stuck.

Given that the states did not have the capacity to accommodate the large number of workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar had worked the phones to reach out to the Gulf countries to ask them to take care of the Indians.

Indian workers in six Gulf countries account for 70 percent of 12.6 million Indians abroad. The United Arab Emirates is home to 3.4 million Indians. Another 2.6 million are in Saudi Arabia. Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain are home to another 2.9 million NRIs.

Apart from workers in the Gulf countries, officials said, Indian missions had received requests from thousands of students who were stuck in countries across the world, ranging from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America to Russia, Singapore and Philippines. In Russia alone, an official said, the total strength of Indian students is about 15,000.

“It will be a complicated exercise. Indian missions abroad will compile a list of people who want to return to India, prioritise them and then coordinate with the states concerned. When they eventually land in India, everyone would have to be screened to figure if the person should be sent to a quarantine centre or straight to the hospital,” a government official said.

The foreign ministry will have to set up a dedicated control room for this mammoth exercise, he said.

The Centre hasn’t yet decided when to start the evacuation flights but the timing, and the pace of the evacuation would be heavily dependent on governments in the home state of the workers.

If the home state of a worker is not ready to take the responsibility to house them in quarantine facilities, it may not be possible to evacuate them. It is for this reason that Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had told chief secretaries at his last virtual meeting to quickly set up quarantine facilities and hospital beds.

A Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Uttar Pradesh’s Deoria district kicked off a political row when he suggested to people of his constituency not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors to avoid contracting the coronavirus infection.

In a video, now gone viral, Suresh Tiwari is seen appealing to people: “You all should keep one thing in mind, I am telling you openly: do not buy vegetables from Mia ( Muslims).”

When contacted, Tiwari confirmed to have made the remark and clarified that he suggested it as a precautionary measure to check the spread of infection after people complained to him about the role of Tablighi Jamaatis in spreading the deadly virus.

There have been several instances of the people from the minority community complaining of discrimination and harassment after a global religious congregation in New Delhi in mid-March, held by Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic movement of preachers, turned into a hotspot of Covid-19 cases.

“On April 18, I was distributing masks among people in Deoria when I came across general complaints from people who expressed fear that Tablighi Jamaatis are spreading the infection in Deoria. Many of them were worried that Muslim vendors are infecting vegetable with saliva. As a responsible MLA, I asked them not to take law in their hand, but simply stop buying vegetables from them. Tell me, what wrong have I done by saying such things,” said the Barhaj MLA.

Tiwari’s remark drew sharp reaction from the opposition parties.

UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu blamed the legislator’s party for spreading hatred even at the time of a pandemic .

“At a time when the country and state are facing the coronavirus crisis, BJP leaders are busy fanning hatred .It’s a shameful act which has exposed the real face of the BJP.

Authorities in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have said the quality of water in the Ganga has improved during the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, with samples collected by a research facility in Varanasi recording a nearly 30% decrease in pollution levels.

A study of Ganga water samples collected on March 24, before the lockdown was imposed, and those collected on April 20 showed pollution had decreased by 25% to 30%, said BD Tripathi, chairman of the Mahamana Malviya Research Centre for Ganga, River Development and Water Resource Management at Banaras Hindu University (BHU).

Composite samples of the river water were collected from five locations – Shooltankeshwar Ghat, Samne Ghat, Asi Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat and Raj Ghat – on the two dates, he said. He explained that the term composite samples means an average of five samples were collected from different spots of every site to ensure accurate results.

“We tested biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the dissolved oxygen (DO) level in the samples. We found the concentration of DO increased by 20% to 30% and the concentration of BOD decreased by 35% to 40%. In total, the Ganga pollution load has decreased by 25% to 30%,” Tripathi said.

“There has been a very positive effect on the Ganga and the river shows it can rejuvenate itself,” he added.

Tripathi attributed the decrease in pollution to many reasons, including a decrease of around 40% in the number of bodies cremated at Manikarnika Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat, and a check on immersion of remains of cremated bodies in the river.

The discharge of toxic effluents from more than 1,000 small-scale and cottage industries and motor workshops too has completely stopped at Varanasi, he said.

The “highest transparency” was observed during the sampling of water because fish were seen swimming up to a depth of one metre from the surface of the Ganga, Tripathi said.

In Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun, authorities said a comparison of water quality of the Ganga at different locations from Devaprayag, done between March and April, showed the quality had improved significantly. The water at Har Ki Pauri was found fit for drinking in April, and the state government now plans to work on measures to keep the quality consistent and pollution-free.

State forest and environment minister Harak Singh Rawat said: “With the latest data on improved water quality of the Ganga, we are going to study it with experts and decide on short-term measures which will help us maintain this quality even after the lockdown.

“Clearly, nature has cleaned the river on its own due to fewer anthropological activities.”

Tripathi too said authorities need to take a cue from the lockdown to improve the water quality in future.

Data released amid the lockdown by the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) showed there was a 47% reduction in fecal coliform at Lakshmanjhula.

At the barrage in Rishikesh, there was a 46% reduction in fecal coliform and 25% reduction in total coliform. Similarly, at Bindughat Dudhiavan, there was a 25% and 11% reduction in fecal coliform and total coliform, respectively.

At Har Ki Pauri, there was a 20% reduction in BOD, 34% reduction in fecal coliform and 17% reduction in total coliform, whereas at Jagjeetpur in Haridwar, officials observed a 17% reduction in BOD and fecal coliform and a 27% reduction in total coliform.

UEPPCB officials said there was a significant improvement in water quality at Har ki Pauri during the lockdown. UEPPCB member secretary SP Subudhi said fewer pollutants are entering the river as factories are closed.

“We studied data from March and April and saw significant changes in water quality after the lockdown. This is mostly due to factories being shut, hotels being closed, and less mobile population in and around Haridwar,” said Subudhi.

“We will be taking samples from the same spots again to reconfirm the findings, based on which suggestion can be made to the state and Central government on how to keep the water quality of the Ganga consistent.”

Sewage treatment plants in the state are working according to norms and without extra load because of the lockdown, reducing pollutants in rivers.

BD Joshi, an environmental scientist and founder of the Indian Academy of Environmental Sciences, said the water quality has improved due to reduced anthropological pressures on the Ganga but this will be very difficult to maintain once the lockdown ends.

As the foreign and civil aviation ministries start work on a plan to fly back tens of thousands of Indians stuck abroad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spelt out the ground rule for the evacuation plan. India’s blue collar workers stranded abroad will get the first seats in the special flights that will be run by the government to get them home.

Students stranded in different countries will be next. Then, everyone else including Indians who were travelling for work, or pleasure.

“The prime minister was very clear… That the Indian expatriate workforce should get the first choice to return,” a top government official told Hindustan Times.

At one meeting, PM Modi pointed out how the poorest of Indian immigrant workers - mostly in the Gulf countries - had helped India tide over the economic crisis. Like in 1998, PM Modi told them, when the United States and other western countries imposed economic sanctions on India after the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee detonated five underground nuclear bombs in Pokhran in May 1998.

The Resurgent India Bond floated by the State Bank of India was targeted to raise $2 billion; it netted more than $4 billion.

Two decades later, India’s massive diaspora is still sending money home. In 2019, according to the World Bank, India was still the world’s top recipient of remittances. The diaspora sent $82 billion; nearly half came from migrant workers in West Asia.

But the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the Indian workers in West Asian countries hard. Many have lost their jobs due to suspension of projects and are stuck.

Given that the states did not have the capacity to accommodate the large number of workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar had worked the phones to reach out to the Gulf countries to ask them to take care of the Indians.

Indian workers in six Gulf countries account for 70 percent of 12.6 million Indians abroad. The United Arab Emirates is home to 3.4 million Indians. Another 2.6 million are in Saudi Arabia. Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain are home to another 2.9 million NRIs.

Apart from workers in the Gulf countries, officials said, Indian missions had received requests from thousands of students who were stuck in countries across the world, ranging from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America to Russia, Singapore and Philippines. In Russia alone, an official said, the total strength of Indian students is about 15,000.

“It will be a complicated exercise. Indian missions abroad will compile a list of people who want to return to India, prioritise them and then coordinate with the states concerned. When they eventually land in India, everyone would have to be screened to figure if the person should be sent to a quarantine centre or straight to the hospital,” a government official said.

The foreign ministry will have to set up a dedicated control room for this mammoth exercise, he said.

The Centre hasn’t yet decided when to start the evacuation flights but the timing, and the pace of the evacuation would be heavily dependent on governments in the home state of the workers.

If the home state of a worker is not ready to take the responsibility to house them in quarantine facilities, it may not be possible to evacuate them. It is for this reason that Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had told chief secretaries at his last virtual meeting to quickly set up quarantine facilities and hospital beds.

The Union health ministry on Tuesday advised against considering the plasma therapy to be a regular treatment for coronavirus and added that it should only be used for research and trial purposes till the time there’s robust scientific evidence to support its efficacy.

The government added further that plasma therapy could lead to life-threatening complications if not administered properly.

“There is no approved therapy for Covid-19 in the country including Plasma therapy. Plasma therapy is being experimented with and there is no evidence to support it as a treatment. It is only at an experimental stage. If not used properly, it can create life-threatening complications,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary health ministry.

The health ministry official said that the country’s top medical research body was conducting a study to find out the efficacy of plasma therapy and till then, doctors are advised to use it only for trial purposes.

“Plasma therapy is only to be used for research and trial purposes until an ICMR study on its efficacy is completed. ICMR is conducting a nation-wide research to study the efficacy of Plasma therapy,” he added.

Government’s word of caution on plasma therapy comes at a time when several instances of it helping in virus-infected patients’ recovery have been reported. The Plasma therapy has been used selectively so far, mostly in severe cases where patients were on ventilator support.

The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19

Use of plasma therapy involves injecting blood-component plasma extracted from a cured coronavirus patient into a positive case. The plasma of a cured patient is considered to carry virus-fighting antibodies which boost the immune system’s response to the disease. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood.

Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma, which contains the virus-fighting antibodies, from people who have recovered from the infection to treat those who are severely ill with Covid-19

Several Covid-19 fighting medical care centres in India are reported to have started banking plasma from coronavirus recovered patients after its use was said to have shown positive results.

A few days ago, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain had reported that six critical coronavirus patients had “nearly recovered” after administration of the plasma therapy. On April 26, it was reported that Mumbai’s Lilavati hospital, too, had identified Maharashtra’s first patient to be given the therapy.

A Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Uttar Pradesh’s Deoria district kicked off a political row when he suggested to people of his constituency not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors to avoid contracting the coronavirus infection.

In a video, now gone viral, Suresh Tiwari is seen appealing to people: “You all should keep one thing in mind, I am telling you openly: do not buy vegetables from Mia ( Muslims).”

When contacted, Tiwari confirmed to have made the remark and clarified that he suggested it as a precautionary measure to check the spread of infection after people complained to him about the role of Tablighi Jamaatis in spreading the deadly virus.

There have been several instances of the people from the minority community complaining of discrimination and harassment after a global religious congregation in New Delhi in mid-March, held by Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic movement of preachers, turned into a hotspot of Covid-19 cases.

“On April 18, I was distributing masks among people in Deoria when I came across general complaints from people who expressed fear that Tablighi Jamaatis are spreading the infection in Deoria. Many of them were worried that Muslim vendors are infecting vegetable with saliva. As a responsible MLA, I asked them not to take law in their hand, but simply stop buying vegetables from them. Tell me, what wrong have I done by saying such things,” said the Barhaj MLA.

Tiwari’s remark drew sharp reaction from the opposition parties.

UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu blamed the legislator’s party for spreading hatred even at the time of a pandemic .

“At a time when the country and state are facing the coronavirus crisis, BJP leaders are busy fanning hatred .It’s a shameful act which has exposed the real face of the BJP.

The arthritis drug tocilizumab has shown early promise in preventing extreme inflammation in gravely ill COVID-19 patients, according to a French clinical study.

The treatment, which suppresses the body’s natural immune response, was found to reduce “significantly” the number of deaths or life support interventions compared with a control group of patients.

The study, carried out by the Paris university hospital trust (AP-HP), looked at 129 people hospitalised with moderate or severe viral pneumonia, which occurs in 5-10 percent of Covid-19 patients.

Half received two injections of tocilizumab as well as standard treatment with antibiotics, while the control group received only standard treatment.

While the results are yet to be published, those involved in the research said it showed clear “clinical benefit” of tocilizumab treatment.

AP-HP said it had decided to publicise the study before publishing official results “for public health reasons”.

They stressed however that further research was needed on the effectiveness of the drug and the potential for side effects.

Tocilizumab, sold under the brand names Actemra and RoAcemtra, is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.

It is a lab-synthesised antibody that inhibits against a specific protein receptor involved in the body’s natural immune response.

Researchers believe the drug might be able to stave off a state of heightened immune response known as cytokine storms -- where the body’s reaction to a foreign body such as a disease or chemical creates acute inflammation.

Cytokine storms can be deadly and occur in severely ill Covid-19 patients.

Tocilizumab currently costs around 800 euros ($870) per injection.

TV actor Smriti Khanna, who has impressed the internet with her body transformation days after giving birth, has responded to haters who claimed her postpartum images were photoshopped. She was heavily trolled after she shared her photos a week before and after giving birth to her daughter.

Responding to the trolls, Smriti posted a mirror selfie on her Instagram Story and wrote, “For people who think these pics are old, you really think I will put a cot in my room even before getting pregnant?” She also shared a video showcasing her perfectly fit body and wrote, “To all the haters who think my pictures are edited.” Smriti has also posted a mirror selfie, thanking her fans.

Smriti had shared a collage of her pre and post delivery images where a flat stomach and slim body could be clearly seen. The images used in the collage were from a week before and after the delivery. She wrote alongside her post, “Amazed at what the human body can do!! 1st pic was taken one week before I gave birth. Second pic, a week after I gave birth. My inbox is flooded with questions from new moms and moms-to-be. I’ll try and make a video soon answering all of them. Thank you for so much love and blessings for our little one #postpartum #postpartumtransformation #newmom #mombod.”

While several users trolled her, she also had an army of fans defending her. “M a new mom and i can really recognize its a true pic... n nothing fake in it. And yes it completely depends on the genes n how you maintain yourself during pregnancy. Congratulations.. be happy. N dont give much attention to critics,” wrote one.

Speaking about her pregnancy, Smriti had recently said in an interview, “I was panicking before the lockdown happened. Gautam, my father and brother-in-law, everyone was going out to work and I was the only one staying at home. So, I was panicking a lot at that time because they used to come back home meeting lots of people. I was reading and there was not much information about pregnant women during the Coronavirus crisis. That was causing anxiety which is not good at this time. I was trying to keep myself calm. When the lockdown happened, I was a little relieved in fact. So that way, we are in a safer environment now but still, I am thinking of what will happen after the lockdown. The best thing is you have to have faith in God. The babies are going to be super strong now to be born in this environment and also the moms. I really feel for them. I also have a few friends who are due and we keep encouraging each other.”

Earlier this month, Smriti had shared the news of arrival of her daughter with a picture and wrote, “Our princess has arrived 15.04.2020.” Several of her showbiz industry colleagues and friends showered the post with love. Dia Mirza expressed her happiness as she wrote: “Oh YAYYYYYYYY SO SO SO HAPPY!!! This is the best news. Can’t wait to meet our little angel” while actor Ruslaan Mumtaz commented, “Hey, such great news. congratulations so happy for you guys @smriti_khanna.”

Over four per cent of health workers in Delhi including 33 doctors have become affected due to coronavirus said Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and added that this situation as “worrying”.

Harsh Vardhan’s comments reported by a news agency were made on Tuesday when the minister held a review meeting via video conference with top officials of the state, including the lieutenant governor (LG), health minister, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) commissioners and DCPs of all districts of the national capital along with surveillance officers and heads of government hospitals.

It also states that nearly 5.11 lakh additional PPEs (Personal Protection Equipment) had been supplied by the Centre to the states to augment the existing stock of 2.75 lakhs of PPE available with the states.

Delhi has 4039 cases of coronavirus as per the latest figures released by the ministry of health and nearly 100 containment zones—areas with positive cases that present a threat of further transmissions. Dr Harsh Vardhan said that this number should come down before adding that the existing periphery of the containment zones could be increased to fight the disease better.

“According to experts, we need to increase the periphery of sealed areas in Delhi to fight Covid-19 better,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said while talking about the containment efforts in Delhi.

Cherry harvesting has begun in Himachal Pradesh amid the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 with growers not hopeful of getting good profits as most markets remain closed.

It has been a double whammy of sorts for growers as untimely rain and snow in the higher reaches in the first two weeks of April first impacted fruit development due to a sharp drop in temperature. Just 50% yield is expected this time as against last year’s bumper cherry crop, which was almost 60% higher than that of the previous year, at 225 metric tonnes, which led to a drop in market prices.

Another factor that growers are worried about is that Delhi’s Azadpur Market, from where many of them market the produce, is now a major Covid-19 hotspot. Jahangirpuri, another hotspot, is also facing a labour shortage, because of which traders in the Capital have informed growers in HP about their inability to buy the fruits.

“We are engaged in cherry cultivation and harvesting has already begun. We have been holding discussions with Azadpur traders with whom we have a longstanding agreement for fruit procurement,” said the general secretary of the Kotgarh Horticultural and Environment Society. Desperate for help, the growers have now approached buyers like Reliance and Big Basket for purchasing the highly perishable fruit.

The society has also suggested that the government allow major companies to send their air conditioned trucks up to Theogh for transporting the produce out of the state. Much of the produce is sold in Punjab and Shimla. “Since Punjab is under lockdown and tourism season has gone for a toss, it’s going to be very difficult to sell the produce,” said Anup Bhailak, a grower in Kotgarh.

More than seven varieties of cherries are grown in the mid- and high-altitude regions of Shimla, Kullu, Mandi, Chamba, Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts. At least 10,000 small farmers grow cherries in nearly 550 hectares of the total fruit growing area with 75 % cherry cultivation done in Shimla district.

Cherry is now considered by some farmers as a better alternative to apples. Apple trees take 10 years to grow whereas cherry trees grow in three years.

Actor-writer Lisa Ray, 48, recently returned to screen with a same-sex love story. The mother to one-year-old twins, the actor has been busy juggling her career, motherhood, modelling, writing and inspiring people with stories about her cancer struggle.

In an interview with Hindustan Times, the Afreen girl opened up about turning a bride for her new show Four More Shots and how different it was from her real-life wedding with Jason Dehni. She also shared the details of her upcoming project with AR Rahman and much more. Excerpts:

Bani’s Umang in Four More Shots Please! leaves your character Samara because she doesn’t feel they are equal in the relationship. How important is equality in a relationship?

It’s essential. Perhaps I would have done the same thing in Bani’s place, but I also see Samara’s point of view very strongly. Why should a woman give up her career and opportunities for love? And the entertainment business is very fickle and erratic -- you don’t work for months or years and suddenly a juicy opportunity lands in your lap. What’s great about the series is that there’s no clear villain - some people have seen Umang’s point of view, but also a lot of the audience also seems to sympathise with Samara.

Has intimacy left weddings and they have become more of a spectacle? What is your idea of a perfect wedding?

I can tell you I wasn’t half as dolled up for my own wedding as I was for Umang and Samara’s on the show. All of Samara’s qualities are opposite to me. I hate attention. I’m very casual and dressed down and my own wedding was very intimate and simple. It was attended by very close friends in Napa Valley and my friend, Wendell Rodricks who passed recently, designed a very simple gown in his studio in Goa, while I was on the other side of the globe. I didn’t even have fittings. I’m personally not a fan of big fat weddings. I’m a very low maintenance, fuss-free, an introvert. How different can I get from the character? If people think I’m anything like Samara, that’s perhaps a testament to my director and my performance.

You think as a society we are still far from allowing same sex marriages? What do you think can be done in this regard?

I’m no expert to comment on this. But I have led a very unconventional life. You have to be the heroine of your own story, and not wait for society to change. I’ve always lived my truth and it’s not easy, sometimes you are celebrated, sometimes criticised, but ultimately once you stop living for outside validation, everything starts falling in place. Own your choices.

You have said you never really wanted to be an actor. What made you return to acting and make an exception for the show?

While I never planned to be in acting, I’ve also been in front of the camera since 1991 when I was 16. I’m 48 today and I’ve had too much experience to make any definitive statements. I’m working on my second book -- which is pretty much a full time job along with being a mother- but I’ve always made time for interesting, unconventional projects that challenge the status quo, whether it’s Kasoor, Water, The World Unseen, Top Chef Canada, Veerappan etc.

With Four More Shots Please, Rangita Nandy is the one who pulled me on board. I have become even more fearless after my cancer diagnosis so the opportunity to play Samara was very tempting. I don’t think the current generation can understand how many changes I’ve seen in the entertainment business in India- how I started when the bricks and mortar and very foundation of the industry was being established- so it’s a kick to be able to do a fab project today at 48, in a time when the industry has evolved to a place where finally the female centric stories I want to see are being told.

How does it feel to face camera once again? Will you like to return to acting or modelling?

Have I left? I’ve never been in the middle of everything, even at the height of my fame in the 90s. I’ve been juggling motherhood, writing and my work in India for the past few years. Motherhood is a real juggling act. I performed in a few films recently like Ishq Forever and Dobara and in what I think is a very underrated, ignored film called Veerappan in 2016 and I think I did a good job with the character, but oftentimes, success is very tempestuous. I am not attached to success, but the experience. I’ve been working very hard in India for the last few years, travelling like mad, giving public motivational talks, modelling at 48 which is a miracle of sorts, and acting. My next release will be AR Rahman’s magnum opus 99 Songs and I’m unspeakably excited about that project as well as my next book. There’s never been a binary approach in my life -- as in this is acting, this is writing-- it’s all a chance to express my creativity, though writing is my greatest passion. And frankly, I don’t enjoy socialising or being the centre of attention. I enjoy working on set and then coming home to my life. I don’t subscribe to a celebrity lifestyle.

Since you moved to Singapore ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, how are you teaching your daughters to keep safe?

They are too young to understand. Just like I would advise for adults, reframe your experience. Nothing is innately bad or good, only thinking makes it so. We make each day a celebration.

Actor Irrfan Khan is in Mumbai and has been undergoing treatment at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, his representatives have said, responding to reports that the actor has been admitted to the ICU. More details are awaited.

Irrfan in 2018 announced that he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour, and sought treatment abroad. The actor lost his mother, Saeeda Begum, on Saturday, and was reported to have attended her funeral via video call. Irrfan’s mother was 95.

The actor most recently appeared in Angrezi Medium, which was one of the last films to have been released before the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. The film took a hit at the box office and was given an early release on streaming.

Ahead of the film’s debut, Irrfan had shared a video message about his condition. “Hello, brothers and sisters,” Irrfan said in a voiceover, in Hindi. “I am with you and not with you. This film, Angrezi Medium, is very special to me. I truly wanted to promote this film as passionately as we made it, but there are some ‘unwanted guests’ in my body and they’re keeping me busy. I’ll keep you informed on that front.”

He continued, “One doesn’t have any other choice but to remain positive. Whether you are able to make lemonade in such situations is entirely up to you. We’ve made this film with the same sort of positivity. I hope this film is able to make you laugh and cry in equal measure.”

Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal was banned Monday from all forms of cricket for three years after pleading guilty to failing to report match-fixing approaches, the country’s cricket board announced. “Umar Akmal handed three-year ban from all cricket by Chairman of the Disciplinary Panel Mr Justice (retired) Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan,” read the tweet from PCB.

Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja welcomed the move and said cricketers who have been part of corruption should be punished in the same way. Umar has played 16 Tests, 121 ODIs and 84 T20Is for Pakistan.

Behind bars is where such jack a***s belong! Otherwise brave for more!!” Raja tweeted just hours after Akmal’s suspension.

Ramiz has asked for harsh penalties on cricketers involved in any form of corruption.

“You ask me I would say these tainted cricketers should open their grocery shops. I have no doubt that giving concession to big names also damaged Pakistan cricket,” Raja had said, referring to Amir.

“There is once again talks of redrafting Sharjeel Khan into the team which is not right and can damage Pakistan cricket,” he further said.","‘Officially makes it to the list of idiots’: Ramiz Raja on Umar Akmal, calls for stricter laws",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/officially-makes-it-to-the-list-of-idiots-ramiz-raja-on-umar-akmal-calls-for-stricter-laws/story-J3LKvbB7O4I19zCMDHsrkO.html

The Miss India pageant in 1994 was memorable for more reasons than one. In the reckoning were Aishwarya Rai, a model already and a hot favourite to win the crown, and the underdog Sushmita Sen. By her own admission, Sushmita had wondered ahead of the competition if she should leave the contest as Aishwarya was also competing.

However, she persisted and won the Miss India crown and later Miss Universe pageant; Aishwarya went on to become the Miss World the same year. Apparently, it was the tie-breaker round that tilted the competition in Sushmita’s favour.

Aishwarya was asked the question, “If you have to look for qualities in a husband, would you look for the qualities in Ridge Forrester from ‘The Bold & Beautiful’ or in Mason Capwell from ‘Santa Barbara’?” Aishwarya’s answer was, “Mason. They do have a lot in common, but from what we see, Mason has a very caring side to him, and a terrific sense of humour. And that really gels with my character.”

The question posed to Sushmita was: “What do you know about the textile heritage of your country? How old has it been and what do you prefer to wear personally?” Sush answered, “I think it all started with Mahatma Gandhi’s khadi. It has gone a long way since then, but the basics of Indian textile heritage has been from there.”

Both Aishwarya and Sushmita went on to chart their success paths in the film industry. While Aishwarya will next be seen in Mani Ratnam’s Ponniyin Selvan, Sushmita has been away from the big screen for a while now. She was last seen in 2015’s Bengali film Nirbaak.",How Sushmita Sen defeated Aishwarya Rai to become Miss India winner,https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-sushmita-sen-defeated-aishwarya-rai-to-become-miss-india/story-JqFPL4mLKOKAwHrewa8FkI.html
